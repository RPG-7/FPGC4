# APU
The APU, or audio processing unit, is responsible for generating and outputting (analog) sound. It is connected over UART (plugged into the FPGC4 I/O Wing on a few headers), which allows for easy hardware upgrades, in case I ever want to switch to a STM32 based MCU.

The APU in the FPGC4 is a seperate MCU with its own RAM and storage, just like the SNES uses a seperate SPC700 and DSP chip to generate audio, saving FPGA resources and hours of time creating a complex APU. In the case of the FPGC4, a more modern and capable ESP32 is used as a software synthesizer with an I2S DAC attached to it. It currently works as a MIDI synthesizer, where the FPGC4 sends (in the future: custom) MIDI signals over UART to the ESP32, which then generates and outputs the sound in real time (with maybe a few ms of delay because of the I2S buffer). 

The software is a modification from my ESP32Synth (standalone) project. It is written using the Arduino platform. Eventually, I might be better off using a Teensy3.6/4.0 (because form factor) or some STM32 Cortex M7 (though those chips are HUGE), and make use of their DSP libraries to allow for floating point operations and more polyphony.
