Checklist
This file is a crappy note checklist for verifying that the FPGC4 works.

[x] CPU instructions
halt 	y
read 	y,y
write	y
copy	y
push 	y
pop		y
jump 	y,y
jumpr	y,y
load 	y,y
beq 	y
bne		y
bgt 	y
bge 	y
savpc	y
reti 	y
arith 	y

TODO:
[x] When on FPGA, write a simple test rom
[ ] When assembler updated, write a big test rom

Things that can go wrong in hardware:
SDRAM timing not good 											false, it works fine
timing requirements not met (should get warning)				true, however, it works fine for 25MHz
SPI timings not good 											false, it works fine
some same clock timing thing that i missed in simulation 		false, afik
miswire in quartus top level (should look at warnings) 			false, all wires are connected correctly

Logs:
writing to spi results in a read by MU, and nothing happens in cpu because read_mem is low for writing instructions
PC only handles interrupts when PC is smaller than the internal ROM address

Need to put this in the readme somewhere under new hardware connection section
